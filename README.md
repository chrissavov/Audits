## About me
My name is Christopher and I am a Security Researcher focusing on Solidity and the EVM. I was introduced to the web3 world in 2024 and have started competiting in security contests in 2025.

Below you can find my results in my short auditing career.

I also have rust and SVM knowledge, but have no competitive results so far outisde of Codehawk's FirstFights.
